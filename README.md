Design linear PM motor
I.	To run the simulation for the distribution of the magnetic field of a Linear Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor, follow these organized steps:
II.	Begin by downloading FLUX 11.2. Next, open the program to run the model.
III.	Download the file named PMLSM_Cogging_Correctly_Solved.
IV.	Select icons for the project, choosing between 2D, 3D, or SKEW options. The file extension should be .FLU.
V.	To modify the model's dimensions, start by deleting all project results.
VI.	Use the application icon to delete old mesh data. From the geometry menu, adjust the model's length, height, distances between magnets, and air gap.
VII.	Verify the mesh setup.
VIII.	Choose the solving process option and select "solve."
IX.	Pay attention to Set simulation time specified in each input-dependent step number.
